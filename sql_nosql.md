1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

2. SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database. NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases.

3. SQL requires that you use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. In addition, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation. A NoSQL database, on the other hand, has dynamic schema for unstructured data, and data is stored in many ways. This flexibility means that:

  - You can create documents without having to first define their structure
  - Each document can have its own unique structure
  - You can add fields on the go.

4. Sql databases are an ideal choice for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL is not a good fit for complex queries.

5. SQL databases are not suitable for hierarchical data storage. NoSQL is more suitable for the hierarchical data store as it supports key-value pair method.

6. SQL databases are vertically scalable. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
